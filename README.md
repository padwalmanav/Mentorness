# Task 1: Reels Task on Machine Learning

### Regularization in XGBoost
In this task, I created an original, 30-second to 1-minute video explaining regularization techniques used in XGBoost, such as shrinkage (learning rate) and tree pruning, to prevent overfitting and improve generalization performance. The video includes detailed explanations with voiceovers.

# Task 2: Salary Prediction

### Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the salaries of data professionals. It involves regression tasks and provides hands-on experience in data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning model development. The goal is to predict salaries based on a rich dataset. Created a web application using Streamlit for predicting user inputs.

## To run streamlit application:

1. **Clone the repository**
```
git clone 
cd Mentorness
```

3. **Installing dependencies and Libraries:**
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Running streamlit code:**
```
streamlit run salary_model.py
```
